# Lab 9
> One of the very dangerous attacks that an adversary can perform is a Cross-Site Request  
Forgery (CSRF) attack. A CSRF attack allows the adversary to perform unwanted actions on  
a web application in which a user is currently authenticated. The task for this week’s laboratory  
work is to create a web application which would be protected from such attacks
